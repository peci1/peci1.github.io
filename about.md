Living in the Czech republic, I have two big interests at this time:

- Ph.D. studies of machine learning in robotics at [Faculty of Electrical Engineering, Czech Technical University in Prague](http://fel.cvut.cz "FEE CTU"). I'm also invovled with the [Czech Institute of Informatics, Robotics and Cybernetics at CTU](http://ciirc.cvut.cz).
- Leading a boy scout troop in my home city, and helping a bit to some other scouting activities.
