I'm happy I've found github.io blogs and Jekyll.
Let's see what it's gonna be like - this has been my first blog. 

You can expect some articles about what I've encountered during the work on my free-time projects ([github.com/peci1](http://github.com/peci1)), or during work with [ROS](http://www.ros.org) (Robot Operating System), Python and C++ in my job-study (as I like to call my Ph.D. studies).
